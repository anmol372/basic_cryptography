Oh Lord, I’m on a permanent holiday
I’m going outside to play
I ain’t gonna slave away
Not for no corporate Babylon
I’m never gonna be a pawn in their manipulation games

Oh Lord I’m taking the reins
I’m breaking the chains
I’m never gonna kneel, no way
My prophet is Heaven sent
No preacher or president can lead I astray
They’ll never know
I’m taking Jah highway home

Oh I’ve got my own path to follow
Don’t know if you’ll overstand
I’ve got my own truth to swallow
And you know that if I could you know I would throw my guitar on my back, pick up the slack, and leave here tomorrow
But I know that I am a pawn of Babylon I got to face the facts, embrace the axe, and cut these chains off my sorrow

So I’m on a permanent holiday
I’m going outside to play
I ain’t gonna slave away, no, not for no corporate babylon
I’m never gonna be a pawn in their manipulation games

Ten thousand years of captivity
We must eventually
Open up our eyes and see
They’re manipulating we
With so much uncertainty
And so many mysteries
Why are so few questioning
The unnatural state of things?

It’s a nightmare
We’re living in a nightmare
Everyone’s living so scared
They’re virtually unaware
Of this fear that rules their lives
Occupies, consumes their minds
This fear of bankruptcy
Financial impotancy
It’s funny money, money, money
It’s all this digital currency, woah yeah
It’s all this monopoly money
That keeps us from ever being free

And so it seems we’ll be in this prison for life
’cause if we keep buying then they’ll keep selling the lie
So it’s up to I and I…

Ohh Lord, I won’t be manipulated, mind-controlled, and inundated
I will seek the Revelation, make my life a celebration
I will be the change I’m seeking, manifest the words I’m speaking
I refuse to be imprisoned. I will make my own decisions

I’m on a permanent holiday
I’m going outside to play
I ain’t gonna slave away
Not for no corporate babylon
I’m never gonna be a pawn in their manipulation games

Oh Lord I’m taking the reins
I’m breaking the chains
I’m never gonna kneel, no way
My prophet is Heaven sent
No preacher or president can lead I astray
They’ll never know. I’m taking Jah highway home

I’ll never go astray
I’m leaving the past
And forwarding fast
’cause freedom is here to stay

Oh Lord we got to take back the knowledge
We got to take back the power
We got to take back the knowledge
We got to take back the power
We got to take back the knowledge
To take back the power
Take back what they have stolen from our hearts
And we got to take back the esoteric knowledge
Ohh Lord for too long they’ve been keeping us apart
Ohh yes, we got to take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour

Take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour
Take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour
Take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour
Take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour
Take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour
Take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour
Take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour

Take back the knowledge
Take back the power
